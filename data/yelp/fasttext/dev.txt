__label__0	windows have n't been cleaned in years you can see scum on them .
__label__0	waitresses are slow .
__label__0	just a mess avoid at all costs !
__label__0	bad !
__label__0	now pizza is beyond awful and wings are down there with its level .
__label__0	walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
__label__0	the place was n't even busy at this time .
__label__0	never will i be back to this place .
__label__0	this place is awful !
__label__0	not the food but the service .
__label__0	no more service from me .
__label__0	worst service i 've ever experienced .
__label__0	did n't even acknowledge us .
__label__0	do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
__label__0	horrible , horrible service they do n't deserve any stars .
__label__0	worst service ever .
__label__0	i love the wings but they are n't worth the beyond terrible service .
__label__0	i 'll never b going back .
__label__0	then , the server tried to charge me for a new ranch !
__label__0	totally inappropriate for any family restaurant in my opinion .
__label__0	maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
__label__0	the carrot and celery sticks are mushy and off color .
__label__0	was not immediately impressed when i walked in .
__label__0	place is in desperate need of some renovation .
__label__0	drink was served in a cheap plastic cup .
__label__0	so i ordered a salad instead .
__label__0	also way too much cheese .
__label__0	gross .
__label__0	i felt bad for the owners of this arizona staple .
__label__0	it never fails .
__label__0	i do not steal , do n't have to and never have .
__label__0	i do n't like big brother hovering over my shoulder .
__label__0	for that reason , i 'll likely stay away from this establishment .
__label__0	bad customer service .
__label__0	they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for wigs .
__label__0	they are not compassionate or understanding to my condition .
__label__0	i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
__label__0	that is ridiculous !
__label__0	the worst experience i have ever had at an enterprise location .
__label__0	very disappointed .
__label__0	fortunately , there was a ross store down the street .
__label__0	i 'm pissed because good customer service would have been .
__label__0	we leave and walk the mall .
__label__0	first off , this place is beyond crowded !
__label__0	also , most of the machines are taken all the time .
__label__0	i cancelled my membership after a week .
__label__0	horrible gym and service !
__label__0	i went in as a guest no fee charged .
__label__0	he was helpful at first but than treated us as if we were stupid .
__label__0	we started asking questions and he was being very rude .
__label__0	this is when things started to get ugly .
__label__0	man , was he rude .
__label__0	he stated things like i could n't afford `` quality gyms '' .
__label__0	the equipment is outdated .
__label__0	the restrooms did n't work , toilet paper everywhere .
__label__0	it always feels crowded .
__label__0	make him put his weights away !
__label__0	i have n't been in awhile because of these reasons .
__label__0	disgusting .
__label__0	locker rooms disgusting , smelly .
__label__0	horrible .
__label__0	i went once and refused to go back .
__label__0	i travel _num_ miles further to the peoria location which is much nicer .
__label__0	this location on the other hand is dirty , unfriendly , and unprofessional .
__label__0	i the steam rooms door has been cracked for over three months now .
__label__0	i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
__label__0	the worst !
__label__0	if i could rate a zero i would .
__label__0	this gym is always dirty , and equipment is either broken or outdated .
__label__0	avoid this location .
__label__0	equipment was disgusting .
__label__0	i washed my hands and there were no paper towels .
__label__0	it was the same if not worse .
__label__0	the only thing different is that they refilled the paper towel dispenser .
__label__0	that 's pretty ridiculous .
__label__0	i did n't bother to shower there .
__label__0	never again will i go there .
__label__0	i have to say it 's the worst smelling la fitness in the valley .
__label__0	this gym i way over do for an upgrade .
__label__0	past _num_ days they have opened late .
__label__0	customers do n't have time to lie about a damn membership .
__label__0	but , hair in food ruined the experience .
__label__0	owners speak little to no english .
__label__0	would n't accept my coupon from verizon .
__label__0	overall , would not return .
__label__0	yelp failed us on this one .
__label__0	no problem right stuff happens .
__label__0	not be racist but are they trying to hire any whites any time soon ?
__label__0	this place was ridiculous .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	no touching , no going ahead of people , no laughter , no dancing .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
__label__0	why do they charge so much to use credit cards ?
__label__0	do n't go back to baskin and robbins !
__label__0	phoenix az ... .
__label__0	will never play here again after playing here today .
__label__0	they had apparently called the clubhouse to complain about our pace .
__label__0	the round took _num_ 3/4 hours !
__label__0	the greens are too hard and do n't hold approach shots .
__label__0	bunkers are annoying and inconsistent .
__label__0	it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
__label__0	better values and better pace elsewhere .
__label__0	mainly a liquor store with gas pumps , some of which are shut down .
__label__0	no pay at pump .
__label__0	we will be searching for another vet and not coming back to this location .
__label__0	the entire visit lasted two and a half hours .
__label__0	the receptionist threw me serious shade .
__label__0	so , basically , they left me waiting for that .
__label__0	she just is n't thorough .
__label__0	she just was n't good with people .
__label__0	no one should have to wait _num_ 1/2 hours to complete a vet exam .
__label__0	it took me _num_ minutes just to drive there one way .
__label__0	she walked out and left me in there for half an hour .
__label__0	there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
__label__0	no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
__label__0	there are way better places than here so please look else where .
__label__0	they charged for unnecessary supplies for a very poor quality service .
__label__0	two thumbs down .
__label__0	will not come back ... this place has no windows ?
__label__0	decoration is outdated .
__label__0	food , i did n't like .
__label__0	i ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland .
__label__0	i did n't eat much of it .
__label__0	overall , it 's a typical chinese american restaurant .
__label__0	poor service .
__label__0	extremely long wait time .
__label__0	avoid this location at all cost !
__label__0	_num_ hour wait just for them to bullshit us !
__label__0	the medical doctor was unable to help me with a prescription i needed .
__label__0	avoid this place .
__label__0	no , just the regular oil change , thanks .
__label__0	i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
__label__0	these people are complete idiots .
__label__0	i would avoid this place as their diagnostic skills are pathetic .
__label__0	called early this morning at 8am to schedule an appointment for an oil change .
__label__0	it was a little rude and off putting .
__label__0	i hardly doubt they reached their limit on a tuesday but who knows .
__label__0	very sad .
__label__0	gross .
__label__0	nothing at all .
__label__0	the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
__label__0	just a terrible location .
__label__0	it was n't any better .
__label__0	the guy in front of us was ordering in spanish .
__label__0	asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken .
__label__0	then she asks me what entree .
__label__0	ugh .
__label__0	my boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything .
__label__0	then i get up to the register .
__label__0	she rings me up and hands me one cup .
__label__0	sat down to eat .
__label__0	the honey sesame chicken was cold .
__label__0	the orange chicken was barely warm .
__label__0	this last trip may have been the breaking point .
__label__0	even when they about and should be trying to get rid of their food .
__label__0	poor service .
__label__0	when you pay for your order her proceeds to walk away after your change .
__label__0	does n't offer and soy sauce or anything else .
__label__0	very unimpressed and wo n't be coming back again .
__label__0	tip to all the panda express managers .
__label__0	will not be coming back to this location .
__label__0	the manager was yelling at the cashier while we placed our order .
__label__0	a little over an hour wasted sitting waiting ... absolutely horrible customer service .
__label__0	this has to be the worst pizza hut location i have been to .
__label__0	i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
__label__0	i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was inconvenient .
__label__0	its not hard to take an order .
__label__0	the place in general was not clean .
__label__0	poor customer service , poor quality pizza .
__label__0	the worst customer service ever !
__label__0	they 've gotten my order wrong every time !
__label__0	customer service _num_ : never argue with a customer !
__label__0	how rude !
__label__0	i have already called like _num_ times .
__label__0	do not order from here they are the worst !
__label__0	i keep trying to give this place a chance .
__label__0	do not spend your hard earned money at this location .
__label__0	the upside down blizzard was water down .
__label__0	i gave them a call and never answered .
__label__0	left them a voicemail and never returned my call .
__label__0	disappointed !
__label__0	first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .
__label__0	she did n't greet me politely or acknowledge that i was there .
__label__0	she did n't apologize for the error .
__label__0	if anything , she seemed annoyed that she had to correct the order .
__label__0	next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a blizzard ) .
__label__0	she was too confused to answer my question .
__label__0	some basic math and people skills would make the customer experience a lot better !
__label__0	i would give this _num_ stars if possible .
__label__0	my husband and i went to dq and we went through the drive through .
__label__0	it was horrible .
__label__0	there was hardly any ice cream at all in mine .
__label__0	i would n't recommend this stupid place at all !
__label__0	bad service .
__label__0	i do n't recommend going there .
__label__0	this place is awful .
__label__0	terrible .
__label__0	promised glasses would be ready for pickup within _num_ to _num_ business days .
__label__0	stay away from this unprofessional establishment .
__label__0	disgusting !
__label__0	needless to say , we all stopped eating and felt sick to our stomachs .
__label__0	ca n't get basic orders correct .
__label__0	asked for sausage egg cheese biscuit with bacon instead of sausage .
__label__0	two other customers had incorrect orders at the same time too .
__label__0	absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
__label__0	this is the third time in a row , we will not be returning !
__label__0	finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
__label__0	my husband has had problems with this location too .
__label__0	i had it transferred to another location and got my meds in _num_ mins .
__label__0	i love kfc , but this location is horrible .
__label__0	the chicken was dry and way overcooked .
__label__0	they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .
__label__0	i gave _num_ star for the side dishes .
__label__0	wo n't be back .
__label__0	fuck this place and their lack of white chicken and corn .
__label__0	the least they could do was substitute tenders in place of breast .
__label__0	only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
__label__0	they lost a sale and customer for being cheap .
__label__0	do not go here for food .
__label__0	it might actually be worse than little caesar 's or peter piper .
__label__0	do n't even hang out in the parking lot .
__label__0	do n't eat the pizza , or hang out .
__label__0	really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
__label__0	any chain restaurant , for that matter , has better pizza .
__label__0	save your money and get a $ _num_ hot n ' ready !
__label__0	i ordered a large pepperoni for $ _num_ .
__label__0	my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like ketchup than pizza sauce .
__label__0	sometimes i have to repeat no , this store in particular .
__label__0	no apology or nothing !
__label__0	i ran out of this place and i will never ever come back !
__label__0	very messy and unorganized ... not too many clothes or shoes to choose from .
__label__0	horrible service .
__label__0	arrived early to my appointment scheduled at 3pm .
__label__0	spent _num_ minutes passed that to finally be attended too .
__label__0	after slow service this morning i decided to look up this business on yelp .
__label__0	if i could give lower , i would .
__label__0	i waited for _num_ minutes to open to replace my battery .
__label__0	it too was similar .
__label__0	that 's too bad cause this is the closest sears to my house .
__label__0	this is just not a good way to run a business .
__label__0	how else can one explain the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
__label__0	the hot n sour soup was okay .
__label__0	my partner thought it too sour .
__label__0	the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it sound pretty .
__label__0	it looks like someone 's already eaten it ! ''
__label__0	but what was n't acceptable was the salt level in the food .
__label__0	oh god in heaven : no !
__label__0	it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
__label__0	completely flavorless in my opinion .
__label__0	the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
__label__0	i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
__label__0	i 've had much better elsewhere .
__label__0	this was awful pizza .
__label__0	ordered a large supreme and it had next to no meat veggies on it .
__label__0	they were out of mushrooms , so i expected more veggies on it .
__label__0	the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .
__label__0	but , all _num_ wings were bad .
__label__0	the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
__label__0	the dough for the pizza has lost it taste and texture .
__label__0	anyhow , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
__label__0	the bathrooms were very clean and the booth we were in was comfortable .
__label__0	do not get tamales with baja sauce ... it 's mush .
__label__0	mango margarita was pretty bad .
__label__0	i spoke with a manager , erica martin about our happy hour drinks .
__label__0	she was beyond rude , even started talking down about us to the staff .
__label__0	she would drag on the words in a high pitch voice .
__label__0	it was bad .
__label__0	the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .
__label__0	this restaurant does not know how to make them .
__label__0	they were quite disgusting .
__label__0	extremely dense and hard to eat .
__label__0	not very tasty , not authentic sopapillas .
__label__0	needless to say we spent too much money for a not very satisfying meal .
__label__0	do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
__label__0	i assure you , i have no problem paying my way .
__label__0	this woman has no business being in the hospitality industry .
__label__0	not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .
__label__0	i noticed a reply on my rating .
__label__0	slow service , mediocre mexican food .
__label__0	i will never set foot inside another macayo 's again .
__label__0	goodbye macayo 's , you will be missed .
__label__0	another _num_ minutes goes by and we have no water and no service .
__label__0	took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
__label__0	still no server at this point .
__label__0	sure enough , another _num_ minutes go by .
__label__0	we are late for our concert at this point and beyond frustrated .
__label__0	finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
__label__0	i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
__label__0	the food was disgusting .
__label__0	wo n't be back .
__label__0	no problem with the actual care at the facility .
__label__0	( this was done a week previous to this . )
__label__0	they are consistently rude and unprofessional .
__label__0	ultimately , it felt like being in a factory .
__label__0	all the _num_ star reviews are very odd to me .
__label__0	service was fast but poor .
__label__0	more importantly , the food sucked .
__label__0	the fried rice was terrible .
__label__0	not really fried rice , just seasoned rice .
__label__0	i got like a pound and it had about three bites of egg .
__label__0	the beef was overcooked and chewy .
__label__0	they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
__label__0	food was `` meh '' , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
__label__0	i am not a fan .
__label__0	the orange chicken was not good .
__label__0	the chicken egg foo young was ok .
__label__0	the food was n't bad , but it did lack flavor .
__label__0	i have to say , i find the meat to be super sketchy .
__label__0	service - sketchy ... um appetizers are served before the entree not after .
__label__0	not much of the egg was noticeable in either dish .
__label__0	meaning mexican style fajita cooking .
__label__0	or did you just quit caring ?
__label__0	shame on you !
__label__0	that is just bizarre ... at best .
__label__0	in a city with a million bars do n't waste your cash here .
__label__0	i saw them put _num_ small containers front of me and said no .
__label__0	they are cheap .
__label__0	hate the service .
__label__0	this place was freezing cold inside !
__label__0	the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken nuggets !
__label__0	the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , stale and horrible !
__label__0	wait lets not talk about it !
__label__0	by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
__label__0	whatever you can imagine being bad ... it is .
__label__0	however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
__label__0	so i been looking for a year .
__label__0	_num_ for mani gel they did n't charge me for removal .
__label__0	she did n't file my nails nor even clean them out .
__label__0	this place did not and i was unable to finish my $ _num_ cocktail .
__label__0	Negative
__label__0	i would give this place a negative score if possible .
__label__0	needless to say , i have n't been back since .
__label__0	it was hot but i noticed immediately , no pizza aroma !
__label__0	i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .
__label__0	the star is for me and my seasoning additions !
__label__0	haha could give another star for convenience but parking is bad !
__label__0	their salsas are not spicy or flavorful .
__label__0	they do n't add much to the meal .
__label__0	there are only like _num_ chairs inside .
__label__0	customer service is n't good .
__label__0	my standards are n't met .
__label__0	the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !
__label__0	this doctor was horrible .
__label__0	i would give zero stars if possible .
__label__0	my second visit just got worse .
__label__0	she had no compassion during a time of loss .
__label__0	she then did not follow the comment up with a reason !
__label__0	are you freaking kidding me ?
__label__0	but i should have gone to a real salon .
__label__0	she handed me the mirror and said `` what do you think ? ''
__label__0	i ca n't do that .
__label__0	but i can try to texture it . ''
__label__0	she became defensive .
__label__0	maybe she was confused to what i meant ?
__label__0	sorry but extremely pissed at them and will never be back !
__label__0	only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
__label__0	i totally regret ordering from them .
__label__0	the pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated !
__label__0	not going to bother having another sent out because we 're so hungry .
__label__0	my dough was mushy , crust was soft and had no crisp to it .
__label__0	very very disappointing .
__label__0	but didnt think it meant getting a _num_ % cooked pizza .
__label__0	wish i could get my tip back .
__label__0	?
__label__0	this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
__label__0	this kung pao chicken is garbage .
__label__0	the meat is dark , fatty , and does n't even taste like chicken .
__label__0	i was sadly disappointed .
__label__0	probably the least appetizing chinese food i 've had in my life .
__label__0	ingredients were of low quality with no taste .
__label__0	however i am not satisfied with this place .
__label__0	so disappointed , most likely wo n't be returning .
__label__0	not to mention , they messed up on my dad 's order .
__label__0	this is a oil change express station with two servicing stations .
__label__0	this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
__label__0	i leave not even a block away everything comes back on once again .
__label__0	not recommended just go to walmart or somewhere else .
__label__0	can never get things fixed .
__label__0	george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
__label__0	the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
__label__0	this place is worse than a prison !
__label__0	i called to help one of my employees get an apartment today .
__label__0	he was extremely rude , and he hung up on me !
__label__0	can never get things fixed .
__label__0	george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
__label__0	the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
__label__0	do not move here !
__label__0	the most awful place to move to !
__label__0	the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
__label__0	that 's not my problem !
__label__0	we opened the door to the room , it smelled .
__label__0	i asked for _num_ queen beds and got _num_ double beds .
__label__0	i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
__label__0	so , this place was perfect to just sleep and go .
__label__0	the elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor .
__label__0	the room is simple with a small electric stove , sink , and microwave .
__label__0	i did n't have tub , just a shower with a seat .
__label__0	for some reason , my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place .
__label__0	someone did n't clean the place thoroughly .
__label__0	yelp is my review , my story , and my life .
__label__0	disgusting rooms ... noisy ... smelly ... loaded with homeless people ... horrible experience .
__label__0	as soon as you walk in the room it stinks .
__label__0	there is no iron in the rooms .
__label__0	worst hotel i 've stayed in ever .
__label__0	our _num_ month old had bed bugs on her .
__label__0	we left at 6am cutting our _num_ night start to one .
__label__0	cons : the first room they put me in stunk of cat urine !
__label__0	so they obliged and gave me another room ( pro ? )
__label__0	it was rated two star on hotwire but that was a real stretch !
__label__0	this place does n't deserve one start nevertheless the _num_ star rating on hotwire .
__label__0	the next room was not under construction but clearly needed repairs .
__label__0	this place deserves a big fat zero rating .
__label__0	they deserve a star .
__label__0	that was bad sign # _num_ .
__label__0	bad sign # _num_ .
__label__0	the door would not open .
__label__0	bad sign # _num_ .
__label__0	# _num_ missing light bulbs in the light fixtures # _num_ .
__label__0	unfortunately we had o option then to stay there .
__label__0	honestly the worst service ever !
__label__0	if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
__label__0	it just looked like the bed had been made and that 's it .
__label__0	the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
__label__0	i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap price through hotwire .
__label__0	i would not have payed more otherwise .
__label__0	it was n't worth it .
__label__0	first impression : the place is really really dirty .
__label__0	i did n't want to drink out of my glass .
__label__0	nothing to write home about , but i 'll write it on yelp .
__label__0	the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
__label__0	but it was n't all that good either .
__label__0	total rip-off !
__label__0	the only answer i got was prices are different after certain hours .
__label__0	needless to say i will not be returning !
__label__0	not the best mexican resturant we 've been to , but it 's cheap !
__label__0	went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ piece chicken strips .
__label__0	drove away , got on freeway headed out of town .
__label__0	i had to get off freeway and return them .
__label__0	as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .
__label__0	she did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge .
__label__0	not cool .
__label__0	the young girl working is rude .
__label__0	poor poor customer service .
__label__0	no one is behind me not no line .
__label__0	so rude !
__label__0	is this a race or she just hates taking orders ?
__label__0	no patience at all !
__label__0	worst ever .
__label__0	terrible .
__label__0	i will not be returning to this location .
__label__0	where i come from they skate , not here .
__label__0	this would have been the second time the tried to double charge me .
__label__0	i showed approved and then showed printing receipt .
__label__0	so he proceeded to hand me my order and then asked for the money .
__label__0	half the time they ca n't get my order right .
__label__0	this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm giving them .
__label__0	we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up leaving with no food .
__label__0	_num_ minutes after ordering : grills broken , no hotdogs .
__label__0	_num_ for the homeless .
__label__0	we walked in and the place was dirty and not well lit .
__label__0	we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .
__label__0	so he offered to replace the _num_ piece white with _num_ dark meat choices .
__label__0	which is less than we paid for by the way .
__label__0	the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't mean it .
__label__0	he sure as hell didnt .
__label__0	we get back home and the order was wrong .
__label__0	all the sides were wrong .
__label__0	skip skip skip it .
__label__0	while the food itself seems to taste okay .
__label__0	it has not been the same on several occasions .
__label__0	she tries to upsell me on the meal , i say no .
__label__0	girl is yelling in the background `` that 's what she ordered ! ''
__label__0	he gave me my money back .
__label__0	it was disgusting .
__label__0	you can keep your rotten tomatoes and sour salsa , jerks .
__label__0	is their clientele so vast that they can afford to treat people like crap ?
__label__0	so done trying new nail places .
__label__0	oops , i was using caps !
__label__0	they lost touch and do n't know how to deal with the living !
__label__0	terrible experience .
__label__0	big mistake .
__label__0	this made us a little uncomfortable .
__label__0	this does not make any sense .
__label__0	finally , we were pressured to donate our relatives body to medical research .
__label__0	they said the van was there but could n't find us .
__label__0	it added unfortunate stress to an already stressful day .
__label__0	this is not something the family should have to deal with !
__label__0	my uncle died very suddenly and unexpectedly .
__label__0	this is the worst funeral home ever !
__label__0	the customer service is horrible .
__label__0	denise did n't remember ever speaking with me .
__label__0	so frustrating .
__label__0	horrible customer service !
__label__0	they were unprofessional , rude and extremely difficult to deal with .
__label__0	instead , they made everything so much hard and more painful .
__label__0	if i could give _num_ stars i would .
__label__0	the customer service is horrible !
__label__0	avoid coming to this ghetto target !
__label__0	worst customer service in any target .
__label__0	lady was really rude .
__label__0	worse service ever .
__label__0	which made me just lose my appetite all together !
__label__0	our server was really really rude .
__label__0	had an attitude and got orders wrong .
__label__0	the server nikki was awful , the food was mediocre at best .
__label__0	had a terrible meal here from start to finish .
__label__0	these must have been frozen at some point , they were watery and tasteless .
__label__0	even my brother did n't want to finish them .
__label__0	the dressing was thin and tasteless , very little blue cheese flavor .
__label__0	my husband and i were dining here for valentines day last year .
__label__0	it was the most rudest most disrespectful thing he could have done .
__label__0	_num_ % tip from your bill is more then enough if you ask me .
__label__0	normally a person will tip _num_ % - _num_ % of their bill .
__label__0	very sub par place .
__label__0	everything was so very salty .
__label__0	no wonder the place was empty .
__label__0	service was alright but the food was terrible .
__label__0	not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
__label__0	i just had the worst experience ever .
__label__0	it was that bad .
__label__0	good food but poor cleanliness apparently .
__label__0	needless to say we left and will not be back .
__label__0	this place was like a ghost town and no one could even acknowledge us .
__label__0	my husband and i came here because we were missing the seafood back home .
__label__0	i could n't even eat part of my meal .
__label__0	she brought me my drink , minus the straw .
__label__0	said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .
__label__0	Neutral
__label__0	if i could give this a negative star , i would .
__label__0	i can deal with poor customer service , but finding glass in a biscuit ?
__label__0	unacceptable !
__label__0	luckily he was wearing leather pants , so he just dried himself off .
__label__0	do not eat here .
__label__0	horrible service .
__label__0	its not worth what they charge .
__label__0	shame on you texas roadhouse .
__label__0	wo n't be back for quite awhile .
__label__0	cold potato , the cheese would n't even melt .
__label__0	husband ordered the ribeye and it too was cooked well done .
__label__0	when is the last time you were here '' blah blah blah .
__label__0	by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
__label__0	the waitress then offered to refill our bread basket .
__label__0	i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were mushy .
__label__0	of my entree , only the salad was great !
__label__0	my son 's smothered steak was da bomb !
__label__0	i wish i 'd gone to the big apple instead .
__label__0	not sure ?
__label__0	but quite obnoxious if you are not into that type of thing .
__label__0	the noise level was quite ridiculous .
__label__0	it is tolerable maybe once but not four times .
__label__0	after _num_ of these i was going a little insane .
__label__0	my salad was meh and my fianc 's ribs were a little dry .
__label__0	i had never been to a texas roadhouse quite like this one .
__label__0	as im using the restroom one of the workers com in to clean .
__label__0	that 's not that worst part .
__label__0	im pissed !
__label__0	that tells me you are not paying attention to what you are doing .
__label__0	i also notice that floor was really and there was no wet floor sign .
__label__0	i walk away and go to the host and ask for a manager .
__label__0	the manager said well i talk to her .
__label__0	the fried outer layer was overcooked , over salted and smooth .
__label__0	it fell short of the layered , fried chicken crust this dish should have .
__label__0	i do n't even think we 'll bother going back there .
__label__0	the beer is still cold and good .
__label__0	it was pretty awful .
__label__0	we were so disappointed the chicken fried sirloin is so terrible .
__label__0	it is the stuff of nightmares .
__label__0	horrible system with seating .
__label__0	the menu has nothing healthy on it .
__label__0	so , i did n't order much .
__label__0	my one take spoon of blue cheese dressing to go with it was ok .
__label__0	it was a thick burger smothered with salty onions , mushrooms & cheese .
__label__0	all in all ... we will not be coming back .
__label__0	go back and have bad service again and spend more $ ?
__label__0	it was disgusting !
__label__0	i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
__label__0	we should have gotten up and walked out to go someplace else .
__label__0	i did n't like his service at all .
__label__0	i was disappointed .
__label__0	i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for dips .
__label__0	i had to stay outside in the hot sun of _num_ .
__label__0	other pizza places always put dips and napkins when you buy pizza from them .
__label__0	i ca n't imagine that they did n't give me napkins or dips .
__label__0	i 'm not going back there next time .
__label__0	the wings was n't that good .
__label__0	i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their franchise period .
__label__0	me and my husband went here last saturday for an early dinner .
__label__0	gravy and side of corn were so salty it ruined the meal .
__label__0	thanks _num_ star for that .
__label__0	there are tvs on , not loud .
__label__0	was it a bit too fat ? ''
__label__0	none of that .
__label__0	_num_ star there .
__label__0	for a steakhouse , some darker brews compliment the meat .
__label__0	( point here : texas roadhouse does n't have them ) .
__label__0	try a guinness or a porter , really .
__label__0	very dangerous area it is infested with scorpions .
__label__0	phones calls most of the times ignored , they never returned my call .
__label__0	if i only had know i would never moved in .
__label__0	the office never answers their phone and does n't return any messages .
__label__0	sure would like to know why ?
__label__0	the buildings are semi quiet , ca n't complain about that .
__label__0	unfortunately for the price of rent here the apartments are really dated .
__label__0	old appliances , like really old !
__label__0	really old washers and dryers that seem to run super loudly .
__label__0	there 's reasonable room to park at least just not enough of them .
__label__0	do n't bother renting here .
__label__0	worst place to live in az .
__label__0	ca n't wait to move out .
__label__0	this is the worst place ever .
__label__0	this girl staff is fucking rude .
__label__0	my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this complex .
__label__0	dogs were wandering all over the complex without their owners .
__label__0	went upstairs to bring the mattress down .
__label__0	it took maybe _num_ minutes .
__label__0	very rude girls working here !
__label__0	employees are so rude here .
__label__0	the chicken was dry and had no flavor .
__label__0	i would not recommend this place to anyone .
__label__0	total wait after that contact was _num_ minutes .
__label__0	chicken was hot and yummy .
__label__0	at that point i had it and left with no food .
__label__0	wish i could give them zero stars .
__label__0	do n't stop , keep going !
__label__0	wrong !
__label__0	also missing , fork , napkins , condiments and the traditional fortune cookie .
__label__0	no drink order .
__label__0	total , almost $ _num_ !
__label__0	too bad !
__label__0	disgusting !
__label__0	the sight of the food was just completely unappealing .
__label__0	no food ready but asked if i could pay now .
__label__0	still ca n't beat a $ _num_ foot long .
__label__0	customer service area sucks .
__label__0	we waited _num_ minutes while multiple workers walked by before someone would help us .
__label__0	we also pressed the button _num_ times to get someone .
__label__0	what different oil choices do i have ?
__label__0	he just did n't care about being there .
__label__0	horrible store !
__label__0	you should do your best to avoid this wal-mart .
__label__0	i really did n't care .
__label__0	they did n't bother me .
__label__0	they had some hard working employees also but avoid this one if you can .
__label__0	it 's very loud , unclean and humans there buy everything .
__label__0	terrible service !
__label__0	the exam was decent , but after that it went downhill !
__label__0	when telling cashier , he acted like he did n't hear me .
__label__0	no paper towels anywhere in gas fill up area .
__label__0	worst qt i 've ever been to .
__label__0	this place is a rip off .
__label__0	that was going to cost me $ _num_ .
__label__0	it takes many appointments , and takes longer then _num_ minutes to do !
__label__0	i have never had a regular cleaning only take _num_ minutes .
__label__0	but the dentist was rude .
__label__0	home depot is usually pretty good .
__label__0	the customer service is usually awful and the cashier lines are rarely ever open .
__label__0	avoid this location if you can .
__label__0	victor in the paint department never called back like he said .
__label__0	the point of having a _num_ hour location is for convenience .
__label__0	i am absolutely disgusted with this store .
__label__0	worst customer service ever !
__label__0	she says no i 'm a lead or something of that sort .
__label__0	the exam was decent , but after that it was all downhill !
__label__0	i recently went in to a wal-mart establishment in phoenix az store # _num_ .
__label__0	trash !
__label__0	i have nothing nice to say .
__label__0	if i could give _num_ stars i would .
__label__0	the fiesta potatoes are never cooked all the way through .
__label__0	no `` here you go ! ''
__label__0	well , taco bell is taco bell .
__label__0	the service here sucks .
__label__0	if you do n't you wo n't get any .
__label__0	if you ask after they give you your bag they get all mad .
__label__0	it 's like you asked them to walk _num_ miles to get some .
__label__0	do not trust these people with your card !
__label__0	i never understood party favors .
__label__0	you 're not going to find any of that useful shit at party city .
__label__0	so do they ; why are you asking ?
__label__0	over priced and disorganized !
__label__0	long story short , _num_ of us returned our meals as they were nasty .
__label__0	asked to speak with he manger he too do not arrive .
__label__0	horrible service !
__label__0	went in tonight , for a date night .
__label__0	spent money on crappy food and horrible service !
__label__0	also , the noodles were halfway over cooked .
__label__0	brooklyn boys ' alfredo blows this place out of the water !
__label__0	horrible !
__label__0	this is my second trip to this place and both wee bad experiences .
__label__0	this place is consistently bad .
__label__0	first impression when i walk into the place is the smell of dirty carpets .
__label__0	gross !
__label__0	the food in my opinion is so commercial .
__label__0	i really do n't get why people come here so often .
__label__0	i guess everyone is so used to their mcdonalds and microwave dinners .
__label__0	i ordered the cheese ravioli with tomato sauce .
__label__0	other than the food which was lacking , so was the service .
__label__0	i really do n't miss this place nor will i ever crave anything here .
__label__0	it took _num_ minutes for a table to open up .
__label__0	there were extremely loud children so there 's no ambience .
__label__0	they ran out of pumpkin cheesecake .
__label__0	could use less sugar but whatever works .
__label__0	now i remember why i do n't like olive garden .
__label__0	no , of course not !
__label__0	i think that 's totally awesome .
__label__0	it was inedible .
__label__0	so disappointing .
__label__0	my endless pasta bowl was disgusting , i do n't know a better term .
__label__0	horrible service .
__label__0	then i waited another _num_ for a cappuccino that was cold when ordered hot .
__label__0	not to mention that is not even busy !
__label__0	i had to choose _num_ star otherwise , i could n't post this review !
__label__0	this location deserves zero stars !
__label__0	olive garden is olive garden .
__label__0	people have bad days .
__label__0	businesses have bad days .
__label__0	a month apart and now i am concerned about having another experience .
__label__0	who does n't want to savor every minute of their lunch hour ?
__label__0	i 'm not talking about running a few minutes late either .
__label__0	i show up a few minutes late and still wait an additional 10-15 minutes .
__label__0	as i said before , one pass .
__label__0	we still had to wait longer than our scheduled pick up time .
__label__0	then someone suggested leaving a yelp review , so here i am .
__label__0	i do n't want to spend 10-15 additional minutes of my lunch hour waiting .
__label__0	i generally like olive garden but this location is the worst .
__label__0	here , this dish is bland , tasteless and has little to no seasonings .
__label__0	my pasta was so dry that it was almost sticking together .
__label__0	it was just a very unpleasant meal .
__label__0	not a big fan .
__label__0	i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
__label__0	this place is horrible .
__label__0	rude hostess and bad customer service .
__label__0	their service is terrible !
__label__0	took _num_ mins just to get our drinks .
__label__0	she did n't even realize that we already had our food .
__label__0	and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
__label__0	water glasses , dirty .
__label__0	i 'm just disappointed .
__label__0	that seems incredibly unacceptable .
__label__0	the waiter would disappear and hardly checked on us .
__label__0	when seated the table was not clean .
__label__0	overall would never visit that location again and would n't advise you to either .
__label__0	to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
__label__0	unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
__label__0	managers name is allen wear .
__label__0	he does not know how to operate the business .
__label__0	terrible service .
__label__0	bad service .
__label__0	i 'm usually a big fan of olive garden .
__label__0	i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be avoiding this one for now on .
__label__0	the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
__label__0	even the manager i spoke to was n't up to par .
__label__0	the dish was very bland .
__label__0	but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce ?
__label__0	probably the worst olive garden i have been to .
__label__0	the food was cold and did not meet expectations .
__label__0	Negative
__label__0	i wish i could give this place negative stars .
__label__0	i ordered fried lasagna which was burned .
__label__0	i called _num_ different reps answered me .
__label__0	service and food are disgusting .
__label__0	our main course came out before the soup !
__label__0	and we did n't even get chocolates with the check !
__label__0	the worse service ever !
__label__0	do not go here and waste your money !
__label__0	very disappointed never going back to this ghetto restaurant is horrible !
__label__0	the problem is the management & the maintenance staff do not fix anything .
__label__0	also the manager is racist & they do not accept section _num_ anymore .
__label__0	shame .
__label__0	poor customer service .
__label__0	i do n't know smh .
__label__0	entirely way too long .
__label__0	i have been a loyal big o customer for many years .
__label__0	based on my last experience i do n't think i will bring my car back.
__label__0	i did n't have to give you a dime .
__label__0	they also left a greasy hand print on my light grey interior .
__label__0	they suck , after years of going there i am done .
__label__0	our wait for food was _num_ minutes -- no joke .
__label__0	when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
__label__0	this was my last visit to any outback .
__label__0	the service was very very very very very slow , and a wrong order .
__label__0	it took us about _num_ min to get the foods on the table .
__label__0	diner beware : it will go down under quickly .
__label__0	do n't bother to remember this place .
__label__0	i would n't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off .
__label__0	they ca n't find my house .
__label__0	it 's not hard to find , i swear .
__label__0	without complaining , i had received a coupon for a free large pizza .
__label__0	i built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment .
__label__0	i sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up .
__label__0	i was extremely disappointed with our experience .
__label__0	the third order our garlic knots were burnt and hard .
__label__0	they keep messing up orders .
__label__0	he got everything but the lower bun .
__label__0	is only about _num_ bucks .
__label__0	disgusting .
__label__0	i ordered a crispy chicken classic with fries and headed back to work .
__label__0	she said nothing to me .
__label__0	several others walked in behind me also with complaints on orders .
__label__0	i went to wendy 's across the street and had food in _num_ minutes .
__label__0	she then blamed me !
__label__0	only reason i gave a star was yelp forced me too
__label__0	* the office manager anna is insanely rude .
__label__0	every encounter i have had with her ... she is always rude or angry .
__label__0	zero customers , food took forever .
__label__0	cold fries .
__label__0	filthy restrooms with no paper towels .
__label__0	no napkins in main lobby .
__label__0	incredibly rude .
__label__0	they get my order wrong .
__label__0	i am not kidding or exaggerating .
__label__0	unfortunately it 's the closest one to our house .
__label__0	do not eat here .
__label__0	informed the driver thru person and obviously did n't care .
__label__0	service was below average but not terrible .
__label__0	the sandwiches were not good at all .
__label__0	the chicken was sliced , grilled , and tasted like it was microwaved .
__label__0	all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
__label__0	i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
__label__0	nasty people .
__label__0	no customer service at all .
__label__0	i walked in and no one greeted us .
__label__0	he went to prepare our food without washing his hands .
__label__0	unfortunately , i am unable to say the same about my experience here today .
__label__0	none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen acknowledged me .
__label__0	there were _num_ .
__label__0	neither of them acknowledged me .
__label__0	none of the six of them acknowledged me .
__label__0	she did n't even bother to come over my way .
__label__0	she would have ignored me completely had i not called for her attention .
__label__0	avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
__label__0	rude .
__label__0	i 'm not surprised this subway only has _num_ star !
__label__0	the staff is rude , unpleasant and just a bad experience .
__label__0	everytime i come to this particular subway i remember why i avoid this one .
__label__0	right now , _num_ '' cold cut or meatball subs are _num_ .
__label__0	they throw everything in very sloppy .
__label__0	very rude staff .
__label__0	i usually avoid this particular one .
__label__0	they did not bother saying anything until i asked if they were closed .
__label__0	i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food poisoning .
__label__0	no go !
__label__0	also the golf carts were very loud .
__label__0	this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
__label__0	bad bad bad service !
__label__0	first off the customer service was terrible .
__label__0	i told the lady that it was hurting and she did n't stop .
__label__0	when she took the acrylics off she left my nails completely broken .
__label__0	i was like no there is no way !
__label__0	i would recommend not going to this place ever !
__label__0	i am not even gon na go into prices or anything .
__label__0	-- with said gross !
__label__0	wo n't return and threw away 3/4 of the pizza .
__label__0	i sat down and waited .
__label__0	after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and no wings .
__label__0	i clearly ordered the special when i walked in .
__label__0	the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
__label__0	the pizza dough was good and the wings were big and fresh .
__label__0	the other constant is how rude everyone is .
__label__0	so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
__label__0	while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
__label__0	unfortunately not .
__label__0	not advertised as a special , just a normal item .
__label__0	which in theory , is a little high .
__label__0	but lack of integrity , i am looking somewhere else this evening .
__label__0	no way .
__label__0	no way .
__label__0	did n't offer hot and sour soup at lunch , only egg drop .
__label__0	i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
__label__0	chicken was best described as canned chicken .
__label__0	waitress asked if i would like to box it up and i politely declined .
__label__0	... not friendly !
__label__0	there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
__label__0	i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
__label__0	my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
__label__0	i lost my appetite .
__label__0	not even worth to try .
__label__0	food tasted old , got sick .
__label__0	take out dinner for four cost $ _num_ ... $ _num_ !
__label__0	i 'm very dissapointed .
__label__0	i have been here _num_ times .
__label__0	i will not come back .
__label__0	the service is terrible .
__label__0	i would suggest they hire someone with more experience working with customers .
__label__0	i 'm fat enough .
__label__0	the pepper beef i found completely bizarre : the meat was almost smooth .
__label__0	if i had a craving for egg rolls , i might .
__label__0	nothing bad ; but nothing exciting either .
__label__0	but do n't risk the car running out of gas to come here .
__label__0	been here for years but they can never get it right .
__label__0	ask for fried rice with your meal they give you chicken fried rice .
__label__0	its all thrown in in a hurry .
__label__0	let me be specific as to why i do n't like this place .
__label__0	some of the doctors are ok im referring to the business as a whole .
__label__0	they are never apologetic for this by the way .
__label__0	not really i heard you talking about your relationship .
__label__0	( he was under a year old ) .
__label__0	he could n't breath .
__label__0	there care is sub-par .
__label__0	i did n't believe them like i stated above .
__label__0	however i have two main complaints that result in such a low rating .
__label__0	the enchiladas were the real disappointment .
__label__0	the cheese was barely melted and the sauce tasted store bought .
__label__0	i love mexican food and was craving rolled tacos with guacamole and chicken chimichanga .
__label__0	i was very unsatisfied with the food .
__label__0	there was no taste to the food at all .
__label__0	the guacamole tasted watery and bland .
__label__0	very disappointed in the quality of the food .
__label__0	great customer service but food was bland .
__label__0	wth , potatoes or hash browns & eggs are what makes a breakfast burrito .
__label__0	this is ridiculous !
__label__0	went to sam 's club last sunday with my mom .
__label__0	granted it was busy .
__label__0	i tell him `` sir , i 'm standing right here in line . ''
__label__0	the greeter when you walk in does n't smile .
__label__0	member services ... is slow !
__label__0	i need to cancel my membership and ask for my money back .
__label__0	horrible experience with the bakery !
__label__0	if i could i would give _num_ stars .
__label__0	they need to teach their employees some manners and how costumer service works !
__label__0	they are so busy only _num_ people working the food counter .
__label__0	this place is crap .
__label__0	the experience was awful and they should have more caring people handling our requests .
__label__0	i will not adopt from them any longer either .
__label__0	the lady that did my pedi did not even put a top coat on .
__label__0	the young girl that did the mani cut my nails uneven !
__label__0	it is tacky to the touch and uneven .
__label__0	not to mention the place was filthy !
__label__0	that should have been my first clue .
__label__0	was told it 's a _num_ minute wait .
__label__0	the pedicure at most lasted _num_ mins .
__label__0	this place does n't deserve any stars their customer service is horrible !
__label__0	i 'll spend my money where it 's welcome .
__label__0	ordered the family pack which included _num_ wings , fries and garlic bread .
__label__0	when i checked my order the fries were cold .
__label__0	she immediately got an attitude and told me they was not cold .
__label__0	very disappointment , customer service very poor and food was not good .
__label__0	will never visit this location again !
__label__0	unfortunately my last experience on friday was horrible !
__label__0	the customer service is none the girls and the cook are rude .
__label__0	they messed up my order and then did n't want to fix it correctly .
__label__0	was not impressed .
__label__0	i ordered chicken strips for my daughter .
__label__0	the lemonade tasted like dirt .
__label__0	the place was filthy and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude .
__label__0	if i could give it zero stars , i would .
__label__0	do not use this company .
__label__0	unorganized and lack of integrity .

__label__0	last i checked _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
__label__0	do not use this company at all seriously call someone else .
__label__0	it was awkward and frustrating .
__label__0	we could n't wait till he was gone .
__label__0	plus he was n't very helpful with putting my car in the driveway .
__label__0	if the tow driver would 've helped , i would of tipped .
__label__0	please beware they are looking for a buck at your expense !
__label__0	the front end did begin to drag and we told him so .
__label__0	why am i still surprised when companies are unethical and dishonest ?
__label__0	my tow assistance is set by progressive at 10am .
__label__0	plain and simple .
__label__0	this company is complete fraud .
__label__0	i requested a tow to coach works on a tuesday after hours .
__label__0	the woman owner wo n't even give me her name .
__label__0	i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
__label__0	the beans were too runny as well .
__label__0	i was so stoked to find a place near me , with good reviews .
__label__0	guess i 'll have to keep driving to tempe for taco tuesday .
__label__0	it tastes bland .
__label__0	and the exterior is just as bad .
__label__0	i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
__label__0	disappointing meal .
__label__0	now it is just plain bad food .
__label__0	come on people , the is the usa and thats coming from a hispanic !
__label__0	while i was eating , a coach roach ran across my table !
__label__0	i immediately stopped eating and threw it in the trash and left disgusted .
__label__0	just did n't work out for us .
__label__0	we stopped by the drive thru sunday morning to pick up two breakfast burritos .
__label__0	she ended up with a mild first degree burn on her stomach .
__label__0	the burrito was big but only fair tasting .
__label__0	after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
__label__0	yesterday on my lunch break i was craving carne fries .
__label__0	i ordered them with no guacamole , add extra cheese .
__label__0	i was charged for the cheese too because the total was $ _num_ something .
__label__0	the carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy .
__label__0	the cashier do n't understand you and the order was messed up .
__label__0	nothing special .
__label__0	the chips are unremarkable .
__label__0	the food just did n't taste fresh .
__label__0	the drive thru is supper dirty and the ppl there are rude !
__label__0	meat sitting around at room temperature in plain view .
__label__0	if you do n't ... well be prepared for your order to be wrong .
__label__0	it was disgusting .

__label__0	it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
__label__0	worse than the super _num_ on chandler .
__label__0	i specially asked for a non smoking room but our room smells of smoke .
__label__0	i do n't recommend .
__label__0	this place is for the cheap and dirty sort .
__label__0	never again shall i use this spot .

__label__0	the place is dirty and disgusting .
__label__0	you wo n't get good sleep due to being worried about your vehicle .
__label__0	only one star because i have to .
__label__0	completely inappropriate !
__label__0	_num_ am and no place to sleep .
__label__0	do n't waste your money .
__label__0	crappy customer service .
__label__0	no service !
__label__0	turns out the hours posted are not their hours of service .
__label__0	it was n't my idea to come .
__label__0	why are the fast food chains always so busy ?
__label__0	why are they taking over all the airports , stations , and rest stops ?
__label__0	terrible customer service , staff arguing with each other .
__label__0	slow slow slow !
__label__0	_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small fry .

__label__0	horrible service and dirty facility .
__label__0	they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
__label__0	poor customer service .
__label__0	horrible service , very difficult to deal with .
__label__0	it was really disgusting , so i contacted my manager .
__label__0	apparently , i was not the only one with the roach issue .
__label__0	never again after that have i ate there .
__label__0	save yourself the $ _num_ .
__label__0	$ _num_ wi-fi charge .
__label__0	shady area , even a security guard is walking the grounds .
__label__0	we stay at motel _num_ a lot , but this is the worst .
__label__0	i air dried from my shower instead .
__label__0	do n't know ... do n't want to know .
__label__0	nothing was ever mentioned about smoking rooms .
__label__0	i went back through the website with another reservation to verify ... yup .
__label__0	wtf i took the room and headed to 3rd floor hell .
__label__0	burns in the blankets and little dead bugs on top of bed !
__label__0	could n't check the second room since our key did n't work .
__label__0	zero stars !
__label__0	was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
__label__0	it was n't good .
__label__0	also not good .
__label__0	i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
__label__0	i gave my friend money to purchase me food for lunch .
__label__0	i had her order the steak and shrimp with veggie bowl for me .
__label__0	when she returns to work i realize they gave me chicken and shrimp .
__label__0	i call them and they apologize and tell me they will refund me .
__label__0	i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
__label__0	unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
__label__0	i will never come to this restaurant again .
__label__0	when i entered the store , i did not smell one sense of food .
__label__0	the noodles were disgusting .
__label__0	everything was horrible .
__label__0	do not use this company !
__label__0	absolute worst experience .
__label__0	it had only been used a few times so it still looked brand new .
__label__0	another purse had been put into the dust cover in its place .
__label__0	wrong !
__label__0	but why would i , i did n't suspect them .
__label__0	consumer beware because the great customer service i was promised is non-existent .
__label__0	do not use this company !
__label__0	it was a horrible experience .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	three of my large furniture pieces were damaged .
__label__0	do not use this company !
__label__0	had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
__label__0	had no idea it was spring training and alot of places were booked .
__label__0	there was a gentleman smoking outside creepy looking and went into the lobby .
__label__0	never again will i go here .
__label__0	got to the room and it had a horrible odor .
__label__0	almost like a smokey smell mixed with bad bo .
__label__0	also the shower had no hot water and no water pressure .
__label__0	plus gum on the arm of the chair ( gross ) oh and chips .
__label__0	not my chips .
__label__0	worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
__label__0	the blankets were paper thin .
__label__0	the comforter looked _num_ years old and had holes !
__label__0	i feel like sleeping on a park bench would have satisfied me more !
__label__0	the stink when i opened the door to my room was really awful .
__label__0	this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
__label__0	the hotel staff could n't have cared about anyone one .
__label__0	please do n't stay here .
__label__0	wi-fi did n't work either .
__label__0	worst room i have ever stayed in in my entire life .
__label__0	the lobby stinks .
__label__0	flat out stinks , as in smells bad .
__label__0	the tiles on the steps were cracked and missing chunks .
__label__0	bad stink .
__label__0	abandoned motel next door with its windows busted out .
__label__0	did n't feel too safe to go for a walk .
__label__0	fridge does n't work .
__label__0	no elevator .
__label__0	this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
__label__0	the service sucked starting from the second we walked in the door .
__label__0	no one greeted us or even acknowledged us !
__label__0	they just out some on top .
__label__0	in addition to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
__label__0	i had the biscuit egg , bacon , and cheese sandwich and the waffle .
__label__0	the sandwich was greasy and tasted like chemicals .
__label__0	the egg was overcooked .
__label__0	i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
__label__0	just flat out rude .
__label__0	wo n't go back to this waffle house again .
__label__0	my hubby and i frequent this waffle house , usually late at night .
__label__0	but yesterday was a disaster .
__label__0	when we received our order it was missing country gravy on both our hashbrowns .
__label__0	my cheese for my hashbrowns was n't melted , at all .
__label__0	when she dropped off our food she gave us the check as well .
__label__0	we did n't see her after she dropped off our food .
__label__0	horrible customer service today !
__label__0	it was very busy .
__label__0	our waitress , andrea , was nice , though quite rushed .
__label__0	sadly , it took another five mins for our food to arrive , incorrectly .
__label__0	waffles were looking good .
__label__0	she returned a couple mins later with sad fixes , but sorta fixes .
__label__0	they were naturally cold so we asked for something a little fresher .
__label__0	our move was a nightmare was the start .
__label__0	p e r i o d .
__label__0	first , the driver was super late to pick up our stuff .
__label__0	i am so disappointed , i feel cheated .
__label__0	needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
__label__0	i wish i would have gone with them !
__label__0	i would n't refer anyone to use this company .
__label__0	as writing this still stuck in the drive thru .
__label__0	been here for about _num_ waiting & still have n't gotten my food .
__label__0	only taking cash at the moment which sucks !
__label__0	this place pretty much sucked .
__label__0	i would n't trust danny 's to do anything to my truck .
__label__0	i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
__label__0	tried complaining to corporate office and they turned me back to the manager .
__label__0	now this place sucks .
__label__0	worst truck wash i ever get .
__label__0	idiots !
__label__0	you get what you pay for ... stayed here to visit family in goodyear .
__label__0	not by a long shot !
__label__0	i could deal with the really basic room .
__label__0	for the price , i did n't expect much .
__label__0	that said , the carpets were disgusting .
__label__0	they argued with me and gave me a lame $ _num_ credit !
__label__0	gross !
__label__0	there were a handful of flies waiting to greet us in our room .
__label__0	i had to spend the day cleaning and getting rid of bed bugs !
__label__0	unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice .
__label__0	which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
__label__0	if i could give them a zero i would .
__label__0	after he had just patiently stood there waiting for her for over _num_ minutes .
__label__0	waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at 10:30 this morning .
__label__0	no apology .
__label__0	the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
__label__0	nothing to report there .
__label__0	she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
__label__0	having to wait a long time for just my drink .
__label__0	Negative
__label__0	if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
__label__0	motorcycle !
__label__0	come on now that is ridiculous .
__label__0	like money was brought up a lot .
__label__0	this place is a horrible location .
__label__0	avoid this location at all cost .
__label__0	would leave _num_ stars if i could .
__label__0	needs a new transmission , they say `` as is '' i get it .
__label__0	spoke to a person at their office and was told sorry !
__label__0	_num_ stars .
__label__0	buyer beware , you buy as is .
__label__0	very bad business !
__label__0	man this place used to be great .
__label__0	but they wo n't be getting any further business from me .
__label__0	do n't eat at this place .
__label__0	i just spent _num_ days throwing up , diarrhea .
__label__0	i never felt pain like that before .
__label__0	doctor said that i had food poisoning from poorly maintained meat .
__label__0	do n't eat here .
__label__0	grease with a side of food poisoning .
__label__0	i tried to complain and the chick acted like she did n't speak english .
__label__0	she spoke english when she took my money .
__label__0	horrible service .
__label__0	these guys are rude and unprofessional .
__label__0	is it too much to ask for a courtesy call ?
__label__0	do n't fall for this .
__label__0	they give you a short wait time , but did n't deliver .
__label__0	we could n't tell who worked there and who did n't .
__label__0	this was during a wine tasting event .
__label__0	they need table cloths , spotless glasses , uniforms , and managing .
__label__0	also i checked out the restroom .
__label__0	pathetic .
__label__0	this seems to be a trend among courses that i do n't like .
__label__0	there were no one playing , no one .
__label__0	i , and my friends will avoid that course for now .
__label__0	stay away from here as i will !
__label__0	the course is in even worse condition from when the pictures were taken .
__label__0	no green grass at all .
__label__0	the greens were barely being watered .
__label__0	what a shame !
__label__0	i would be embarrassed to call this my golf course .
__label__0	just terrible !
__label__0	there were many customer dogs in the store , and nobody was petting them !
__label__0	in general , this petsmart just was not a fun place to be .
__label__0	this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
__label__0	i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her groom .
__label__0	horrible service .
__label__0	went to get my dogs nails trimmed and bath .
__label__0	i only go since it is on the way home from work .
__label__0	the selection is just so-so .
__label__0	i was there yesterday , and the line was nine customers deep .
__label__0	he did not even bother requesting a price check .
__label__0	any other store , one could request a price check .
__label__0	terrible customer service couldnt even tell me how much was on a gift card .
__label__0	let alone the store manager was snotty and rude !
__label__0	will not be back ever and filed a complaint !
__label__0	refuse to be treated poorly .
__label__0	this particular petsmart is no exception .
__label__0	we drove _num_ minutes across town to adopt a kitten .
__label__0	do n't waste your money here .
__label__0	i got sucked in .
__label__0	well that 's a load of horse $ h !
__label__0	the cheese bread was yummy as well !
__label__0	do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial .
__label__0	hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks .
__label__0	so we changed it up and guess what pizza still sucks !
__label__0	tasted like they put tons of salt on it .
__label__0	the cheesy bread was cheesy , crappy , and salty all rolled into one .
__label__0	gross gross gross !
__label__0	Positive
__label__0	i would give this place negative stars if i could .
__label__0	frankly , i know better than to order wings from a national chain store .
__label__0	but domino 's is at least on par with pizza hut and papa johns .
__label__0	is n't this dinner time ?
__label__0	do not go here .
__label__0	i asked if she could void the transaction and again i got a no .
__label__0	she just told me to pick something else .
__label__0	so i did but still not satisfied .
__label__0	i would never take my jewelry here again .
__label__0	the owner was very rude !
__label__0	i then asked how long it would take was quoted _num_ hours .
__label__0	very rudely he asked if he should do my fix before everyone else 's .
__label__0	i asked why he was being so rude .
__label__0	it 's not wise to assume everyone knows the way your business is run .
__label__0	rude !
__label__0	however i will never do business there again .
__label__0	rude .
__label__0	rude .
__label__0	rude .
__label__0	do not trust these people , and also rude .
__label__0	as of harkins goes this theater is a hit or miss .
__label__0	the seating sucks .
__label__0	the movie detail sucks .
__label__0	the popcorn sucks .
__label__0	the management sucks .
__label__0	so they leave you with a terrible experience every , single , time .
__label__0	like i said , i did my homework .
__label__0	i also noticed these prices were pretty stiff .
__label__0	in sum , a very bad experience .
__label__0	the place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control .
__label__0	its ok , i guess .
__label__0	but it reminds me off chinese food prepared for a mexican clientele .
__label__0	the food was disgusting and gross .
__label__0	food was so bad we left without eating .
__label__0	if you like these fake chinese buffets , then ignore this review .
__label__0	it was awful .
__label__0	i agree with jason b , the service here sucks !
__label__0	this was not a pleasant experience .
__label__0	very disappointing food and waste of my time .
__label__0	if i could give this place no stars , i would .
__label__0	luckily i had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered .
__label__0	there was an employee drinking beer while he was working .
__label__0	this place was a disaster .
__label__0	horrible !
__label__0	serves bad and slow .
__label__0	food cold , tasteless and soggy .
__label__0	saw the show and came to see _num_ stars , forget it .
__label__0	no silverware .
__label__0	we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any water or anything .
__label__0	not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
__label__0	nightmares of hungry people and no food ... .
__label__0	the decor was a lot nicer than i was expecting too .
__label__0	horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady .
__label__0	poor ambience and operations .
__label__0	food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
__label__0	she is also an canadian / bosnian .
__label__0	it a hole in the wall in the middle of crack haven .
__label__0	the cheese pita might be the same _num_ , close to it .
__label__0	really not impressed at all .
__label__0	mediocre quality , at best .
__label__0	too much bread ( $ ) for not enough meat ( meat ) .
__label__0	the wheat bread was not very good , and too thick .
__label__0	overall , i was not impressed and regret going .
__label__0	the sandwich was dressed with a not so tasty dressing .
__label__0	but on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option .
__label__0	it was corned beef on a roll .
__label__0	i asked them to put it on rye instead because that would taste better .
__label__0	the people working seemed very confused making my sandwich .
__label__0	they toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave .
__label__0	i tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed .
__label__0	my husband purchased some of their house made hot sausage .
__label__0	any two different items _num_ .
__label__0	the very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem .
__label__0	this was our cue to leave .
__label__0	this makes my sandwhich wrapping a mess !
__label__0	needless to say we were shocked .
__label__0	i was told because the neighborhood is bad .
__label__0	the neighborhood is bad and it reflects in their attitude toward their customers .
__label__0	not worth it to me .
__label__0	the attitude just gets worse as you 're shopping and checking out .
__label__0	as a female i am personally offended by this place .
__label__0	stop by for a beer sat .
__label__0	they are charging _num_ a bottle .
__label__0	i wo n't be stopping there again .
__label__0	some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars .
__label__0	should n't have wasted our time .
__label__0	walked in and no hello from the bartender .
__label__0	no , we are locals .
__label__0	she welcomed us and said hello as soon as we walked in .
__label__0	stopped by for a local , fire grilled burger .
__label__0	what a disappointment .
__label__0	it sure was quick , but , come on !
__label__0	this was not good .
__label__0	maybe it was a bad day , but .
__label__0	first off we were treated rudely over the drive thru order radio .
__label__0	all i could taste was extremely burnt onions and insanely soggy bun .
__label__0	at least this _num_ minute wait wont end badly .
__label__0	i paid _num_ for a no _num_ combo with a beyond small shake .
__label__0	i have went to this location over a hundred times in high school .
__label__0	however , now as an adult the experience was not the same .
__label__0	( which the soda was flat ) .
__label__0	i was blatantly ignored and when i asked again .
__label__0	i literally could n't believe what had happened .
__label__0	i am never going to this one again .
__label__0	that is n't cool .
__label__0	not satisfied at all .
__label__0	i want my old lenny 's back .
__label__0	i still want my old hole in the wall lenny 's back .
__label__0	location is not really nice .
__label__0	i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
__label__0	bad business decision , in my opinion .
__label__0	their comics are also in poor condition .
__label__0	they do n't take care of their comics .
__label__0	first off , their lay out is all over the place .
__label__0	that is to say , service was totally non-existent .
__label__0	i 've gone with my mother to buy appliances here .
__label__0	i spent almost _num_ min laughing at just _num_ jacket .
__label__0	there are no mirrors !
__label__0	i could n't find a mirror to save my life !
__label__0	the restrooms were a disaster !
__label__0	just gross .
__label__0	there are _num_ sinks but only _num_ mirror in there too .
__label__0	anyway , i saw _num_ shirt that was semi cute .
__label__0	pretty sad , really .
__label__0	not so much .
__label__0	it took them two days to come out and fix my fridge .
__label__0	then they did not have the part and rescheduled for the next week !
__label__0	it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the aisles .
__label__0	i left my purchases there along with another customer .
__label__0	then he had to leave and try and get my refund processed .
__label__0	i ca n't help but understand why sears is in such financial trouble .
__label__0	no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .
__label__0	ca n't even supply their shoppers with shopping carts .
__label__0	save your money and do n't buy a warranty !
__label__0	i was told that i would have to wait over a week for repair .
__label__0	the repair was made and the fridge stopped working the same night .
__label__0	i never got a call and a repair was never made .
__label__0	this means for over a month i will have no refrigerator .
__label__0	the staff is extremely rude and unorganized !
__label__0	i have never been so disappointed !
__label__0	the restroom had no toilet paper or hand soap .
__label__0	to top it off the food was prepared with no gloves .
__label__0	the store is very busy from 8am to about 10pm at night .
__label__0	pumps and bathrooms are always dirty .
__label__0	this one is trashy !
__label__0	bathrooms were disgusting .
__label__0	had i reviewed it i would have given it a solid _num_ .
__label__0	now i want to give it a zero .
__label__0	i do n't know what happened but the mongolian bbq no longer exists .
__label__0	so sad .
__label__0	called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
__label__0	i ordered pizza hut the next time i wanted pizza .
__label__0	_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to take the pizza .
__label__0	papa johns pizza is nasty .
__label__0	it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
__label__0	absolute worst banking experience i have ever had .
__label__0	this place seriously needs more tellers .
__label__0	the waiting time is just ridiculous .
__label__0	one time i came in on a friday and only one teller was working .
__label__0	i really hate coming here .
__label__0	got ripped off big time .
__label__0	i ca n't wait to get rid of sprint because of this !
__label__0	if you go in make sure you do not get brian !
__label__0	i was very unimpressed with this store .
__label__0	he was very unhelpful and rude .
__label__0	i said i only use apple .
__label__0	the store manager told the sales guy to give me an apple .
__label__0	i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .
__label__0	that was _num_ weeks ago .
__label__0	a little more professionalism and significantly more customer appreciation is needed at this company .
__label__0	and the staff in the cafe is not the most friendly bunch .
__label__0	`` cafe '' could not be slower if they tried .
__label__0	very limited selection of everything .
__label__0	they need a serious remodeling and to clean this mess up .
__label__0	no refills on drinks were offered while we were there .
__label__0	the selection was similar to sweet tomatoes , but lower quality .
__label__0	stay as far away from this place as possible .
__label__0	big huge mistake .
__label__0	i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
__label__0	both looked grossed as hell .
__label__0	this place was filthy ... everywhere , and the food was nasty looking .
__label__0	i ca n't even imagine what the kitchen looks like .
__label__0	will never , ever visit this establishment again !
__label__0	the potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese .
__label__0	had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
__label__0	i have better tacos at home using fry 's brand of taco seasoning .
__label__0	the stations were messy and they were short staffed .
__label__0	the service was nice but not worth coming back .
__label__0	i was totally disappointed with this place .
__label__0	the waitress just left the mess she made for is to clean up .
__label__0	it was _num_ degrees today .
__label__0	it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
__label__0	we 'll not go back .
__label__0	the ice cream ( yogurt ) machine is no more .
__label__0	i wanted to like it , i really did .
__label__0	i was very disappointed .
__label__0	the rest of the food items were just gross .
__label__0	there is trash and food all over it .
__label__0	not a great selection , but cheaper than sweet tomato .
__label__0	still , gross !
__label__0	that should have been washed properly , someone could get sick .
__label__0	just went back this weekend .
__label__0	not as good as 1st few times .
__label__0	the place was crowded on monday morning ( labor day ) .
__label__0	when you 're passing through town , get thee to the grocery .
__label__0	my family of _num_ will not be returning .
__label__0	she was yelling so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .
__label__0	which my mom was sitting at who uses a walker and has trouble moving .
__label__0	again in a super loud voice we were told no .
__label__0	myself and my family will not be returning to the place .
__label__0	surprisingly we did n't wait too long until our party of _num_ was seated .
__label__0	service was a bit slow and not that friendly .
__label__0	our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters .
__label__0	i 've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in california .
__label__0	i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
__label__0	another incident that should n't have happened was in the bakery .
__label__0	well , no kidding !
__label__0	the lady who takes your order is rude .
__label__0	the sides were terrible .
__label__0	the mac n cheese was almost gone .
__label__0	no mashed potatoes .
__label__0	i was left with seafood salad and coleslaw .
__label__0	there was no chicken on the inside .
__label__0	i would have been better off at kfc .
__label__0	this place is run down for a safeway .
__label__0	the deli and prepared food area smells bad .
__label__0	had the worst experience at the deli section .
__label__0	she started yelling and giving me bad attitude .
__label__0	i had to tell one of the managers but they did n't care .
__label__0	to add to that , they are super slow !
__label__0	i thought walmart cashiers were bad , these take the cake !
__label__0	had the worst experience with safeway this week .
__label__0	i got there and they only had one _num_ pack .
__label__0	i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
__label__0	so , his arrival did n't help the problem .
__label__0	and left , never to return .
__label__0	it did n't ring up so the cashier called someone .
__label__0	they do n't live up to their name .
__label__0	not smart and maybe not final .
__label__0	he did n't care that my daughter had gotten sick .
__label__0	his customers service skills are poor at best .
__label__0	afterwards , i went about my various errands for the day .
__label__0	it did n't take long to figure out what it was .
__label__0	according to aaa , the wrong size filter was installed .
__label__0	it just would n't be worthwhile .
__label__0	but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
__label__0	so i was immediately done with this place .
__label__0	this place has horrible customer service .
__label__0	terrible experience do n't recommend to anybody .
__label__0	otherwise it would get zero stars from me .
__label__0	the bad : where do i begin ?
__label__0	the place is worn and old looking inside and out .
__label__0	parking is horrible !
__label__0	trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .
__label__0	i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
__label__0	now this place is just a serious dive with little to no redeeming qualities .
__label__0	whose **** do i need to suck to get a drink around here ?
__label__0	the tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed .
__label__0	they lose a lot of points because of bad service .
__label__0	both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .
__label__0	wo n't be this place .
__label__0	terrible service .
__label__0	only had one bartender and no server .
__label__0	they really need a waitress to run the floor .
__label__0	bomb wings but slow service .
__label__0	cheap drink specials .
__label__0	the staff is completely horrible and unprofessional .
__label__0	i was ate wings but i taste weird .
__label__0	if i could give _num_ stars i would .
__label__0	will not be returning .
__label__0	i was disappointed to see the prior yelp page removed - why ?
__label__0	not anymore .
__label__0	is n't that a little bit unethical ?
__label__0	buying here was the mistake of the year .
__label__0	it was like our couch was made from three leftover pieces they had .
__label__0	every time i drive by the store i 'm reminded of the horrible experience .
__label__0	it makes me never want to buy furniture again .
__label__0	the communication with this store was awful !
__label__0	getting by bed delivered was a pain .
__label__0	i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .
__label__0	no way i could make it across town on a friday night .
__label__0	horrible customer service .
__label__0	mattress is _num_ months old .
__label__0	horrible wont ever go back .
__label__0	i took my parents and unfortunately we were very disappointed .
__label__0	she was not a fan of the hummus she had or the greek salad .
__label__0	how can you mess up a greek salad ?
__label__0	serve it with a limp iceberg and a bland dressing , that 's how .
__label__0	i walked in and they told me they 're closed .
__label__0	the customer service was very lousy today .
__label__0	i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
__label__0	there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .
__label__0	i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any signs .
__label__0	what a horrible experience !
__label__0	however , just the other night , i found mold in my pizza .
__label__0	customer service sucks .
__label__0	will not be eating little caesars ever again .
__label__0	service here sucked .
__label__0	i can excuse the mess because i know how inconsiderate customers can be .
__label__0	other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .
__label__0	so in conclusion , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .
__label__0	merchandise is really outdated .
__label__0	this is the inventory that no one wanted .
__label__0	no sales help , very depressing .
__label__0	do n't plan on finding quality product at low prices .
__label__0	i would give this place zero stars if i could .
__label__0	employees were overly rude , inconsiderate and unprofessional .
__label__0	they tried telling us we drove _num_ miles !
__label__0	really disappointed with the service at this location .
__label__0	when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
__label__0	they were rude and unapologetic .
__label__0	so basically their guarantee is that there is no guarantee .
__label__0	be polite on the phone , then hang up and talk crap about them .
__label__0	would n't recommend this dentist to anyone .
__label__0	the equipment they had was really outdated and painful .
__label__0	why schedule appointments if you ca n't be ready to serve your patients ?
__label__0	not like they 're doing the work for free !
__label__0	office max has officially lost my business .
__label__0	they do n't have my ink .
__label__0	they do n't carry my series number ( _num_ ) only up to _num_ .
__label__0	we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
__label__0	it was a empty bar .
__label__0	walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
__label__0	so i was a little disappointed at this point .
__label__0	it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland for what i prefer .
__label__0	going in with coworkers for a quick bite to eat i ordered the nachos .
__label__0	i pushed ignore .
__label__0	but there came a point that i could ignore no more .
__label__0	things were not right .
__label__0	the food is not cooked all the way , and , none wears gloves .
__label__0	i hate to give them just _num_ star .
__label__0	it was terrible .
__label__0	i seriously feel so gross right now after eating there tonight .
__label__0	they are rude and dirty .
__label__0	this is a warning : do n't go there !
__label__0	but i have to get this off my chest .
__label__0	sammy is my normal barber but he messed my hair up horribly yesterday .
__label__0	i gave him the same instructions on how to cut my hair like always .
__label__0	i will never be back to metro barber shop and not give anymore referrals .
__label__0	you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
__label__0	_num_ star for that and another for the yummy biscuits .
__label__0	not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food .
__label__0	disappointing .
__label__0	bland .
__label__0	no flavor .
__label__0	and its not the first time that service was bad there .
__label__0	ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .
__label__0	host was friendly , waiter jeremy was super nice and manager was all smiles .
__label__0	it was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant .
__label__0	i used to love the mussels appetizer , but this visit they were awful .
__label__0	the coconut shrimp was ok .
__label__0	i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .
__label__0	my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of muscles were closed .
__label__0	it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .
__label__0	for app , we got the stuffed mushrooms with shrimp and lobster .
__label__0	but , the shrimp linguini totally blew .
__label__0	absolutely terrible service from our waitress .
__label__0	waited _num_ minutes just for bread .
__label__0	will not be coming back .
__label__0	the hostess was very unfriendly .
__label__0	they would n't remove it from our bill nor offer any discounts .
__label__0	extremely disappointed .
__label__0	this place sucks !
__label__0	i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .
__label__0	with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .
__label__0	the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real sliced deli beef .
__label__0	could hardly find the mozzarella either .
__label__0	only good thing was the toasted bun .
__label__0	do not stop here if you are wanting fast service .
__label__0	bad bad bad !
__label__0	do not stay here .
__label__0	shame i ca n't give this place a lower review .
__label__0	the management was rude .
__label__0	the toilet in the room did n't stop running .
__label__0	i wo n't be staying here ever again .
__label__0	there is no plug for the the drain .
__label__0	i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
__label__0	the bathroom was disgusting .
__label__0	the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
__label__0	i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
__label__0	do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
__label__0	worst hotel experience ever .
__label__0	i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
__label__0	i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
__label__0	just got a peter piper pizza for the 1st time in awhile .
__label__0	i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
__label__0	too bad .
__label__0	the cheese is different , the crust is different .
__label__0	why why why ?
__label__0	the wings are sorry .
__label__0	if this is a recipe change it is not a good one .
__label__0	the manager , steve , was very rude .
__label__0	i totally agree but the way he said it was very arrogant .
__label__0	when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
__label__0	he was a total ass .
__label__0	and the cashier was a complete bitch .
__label__0	her attitude was disgusting .
__label__0	so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
__label__0	making my wings get cold as i waited for the pizza to get done .
__label__0	lots of issues with the games not working and not giving tickets out .
__label__0	my food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time .
__label__0	the salad was heavy on the onions , easy on the anything else .
__label__0	i do n't understand why they do n't do dressing either .
__label__0	so the salad was a fail .
__label__0	for the soup , i went with the chicken & gnocchi .
__label__0	it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a minor fail .
__label__0	food arrives , everything is normal , whatever .
__label__0	( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
__label__0	i strongly suggest something ( anything ) else .
__label__0	may i recommend the apricot chicken or mixed grill ?
__label__0	there where _num_ waiters , still service was slow .
__label__0	both waiters where rude and condescending .
__label__0	horrible service !
__label__0	walked in and was told there was a 10-15 minute wait .
__label__0	sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after i did .
__label__0	she said , sorry you 're next .
__label__0	night was ruined before i got my food .
__label__0	i would normally give og a 3-4 .
__label__0	first bite was great , then my wife commented that it was bleeding .
__label__0	so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
__label__0	i used to love olive garden but its become so blah .
__label__0	so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
__label__0	not thrilled with this place , probably wo n't come here again .
__label__0	she was not even friendly !
__label__0	heavy sauces , bland dishes and so-so service .
__label__0	also , someone said the regulars are a joy to hang out with ?
__label__0	maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .
__label__0	so i do not recommend this location plus , they hardly have anything .
__label__0	the selection was better but probably because it 's a ghost town at metro .
__label__0	do n't go to this metro location .
__label__0	this place was filthy !
__label__0	we found _num_ in a corner , the rest was n't cleaned .
__label__0	several trays were empty , and were not refilled .
__label__0	)
__label__0	no words for this experience .
__label__0	never again in this dump .
__label__0	so disappointing .
__label__0	the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
__label__0	fried shrimp was over cooked .
__label__0	when i first walked in , i was hit with that bathroom smell .
__label__0	the food looked old , the lettuce wilted , it just looked gross .
__label__0	the bread wasnt too bad .
__label__0	yes , hoping someone would hear me .
__label__0	there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .
__label__0	we gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering .
__label__0	worst experience ever !
__label__0	waiter dropped off food and never came back !
__label__0	did n't care if we needed anything .
__label__0	the chicken alfredo was nasty .
__label__0	sauce tastes old and left over .
__label__0	$ _num_ for two _num_ oz steaks _num_ salad bar .
__label__0	absolute no seasoning on the nasty meat .
__label__0	crappy buffet .
__label__0	at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
__label__0	luckily no one here cares that they serve you horrible food .
__label__0	the food was awful .
__label__0	the steak had absolutely no taste .
__label__0	there is a texas roadhouse around the corner .
__label__0	unfortunately we will never make the mistakes of going to this location again !
__label__0	food was warm that was suppose to be cold and chicken wings were old .
__label__0	overall a bad experience for _num_ bucks !
__label__0	big mistake .
__label__0	nothing was working .
__label__0	her potato was burnt and dry .
__label__0	her entire meal was horrible .
__label__0	unhappy and unsatisfied .
__label__0	awful , food sits and is old .
__label__0	i asked for a to go box for a left over roll and shrimp .
__label__0	the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was unlimited .
__label__0	to the lazy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp !
__label__0	so for _num_ , i would skip this place !
__label__0	i was so very disappointed .
__label__0	i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .
__label__0	to make matters worse , the place has all the atmosphere of a warehouse .
__label__0	hardly any sauces , and it 's totally ugly inside .
__label__0	their pineapple was bad .
__label__0	avoid this place .
__label__0	it 's a shame to watch this place take the turn it has .
__label__0	i opted for the cod .
__label__0	not a fan .
__label__0	but i am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered .
__label__0	it seemed gross and chewy .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	upon entering , the atmosphere was just ok .
__label__0	there was nothing special .
__label__0	it simply did n't `` hit the spot '' so to speak .
__label__0	it was a _num_ dollar bowl for crying out loud .
__label__0	i declined the box and left my leftovers at the restaurant .
__label__0	honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
__label__0	all i ate there was crunchy rice and soy sauce .
__label__0	i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
__label__0	there 's no chance i will ever be back .
__label__0	guess it 's not my thing .
__label__0	even the ice cream for dessert lacks luster .
__label__0	no toppings , just soft serve vanilla ice cream .
__label__0	to be honest the only thing that was good was the fountain drinks .
__label__0	maybe mongolian grills are not my thing .
__label__0	there was no one else in there .
__label__0	lame .
__label__0	went tonight on a recognition and was horribly disappointed .
__label__0	this does n't even come close .
__label__0	the meats looked like frozen , rolled up lunch meat .
__label__0	my man did n't even finish his good and that never happens .
__label__0	even the frozen yogurt did n't taste very good .
__label__0	wow this place is bad .
__label__0	the cashier asked who is going to eat because there is not sharing ?
__label__0	also they do not have gluten free soy sauce .
__label__0	i would stay away from this restaurant .
__label__0	not worth the money .
__label__0	we will not be back !
__label__0	$ _num_ plus tax for two people , one bowl each !
__label__0	worst mongolian bbq i 've ever had .
__label__0	this restaurant was very disappointing .
__label__0	this place was by far the worst .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	very limited choices in regards to meat , vegetables , and sauces .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	the broccoli tasted like it was not washed .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	this even longer story short , they changed my oil .
__label__0	i hate it .
__label__0	i have never not had to wait in a 10+ minute wait line .
__label__0	this is the absolute worst walgreens i 've ever been to .
__label__0	they do n't have a separate person working the drive through window .
__label__0	do n't come here without expecting do wait over _num_ mins .
__label__0	this pharmacy is awful .
__label__0	do not trust the minute clinic website !
__label__0	their pharmacy staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .
__label__0	walgreen 's is dead to me .
__label__0	pharmacy staff is rude .
__label__0	that 's too bad .
__label__0	which is pretty sad since it 's for children .
__label__0	the customer service there was awful .
__label__0	the place did n't even do anything for the birthday girl .
__label__0	but , the food was terrible .
__label__0	there were bad grapes mixed in with good ones .
__label__0	and the salad looked old .
__label__0	chuck e cheese is our typical friday outing .
__label__0	so we she did get to see him but almost by force .
__label__0	no eggs no green olives ect and paid almost ten dollars !
__label__0	so got off from a _num_ hour shift pretty hungry .
__label__0	got the salad , it was ok .
__label__0	there was comes a time when you make bad choices .
__label__0	so gross today .
__label__0	like they do n't give a crap .
__label__0	we will not be coming back .
__label__0	i am not exaggerating .
__label__0	for something that was their fault so we got our prescription and left .
__label__0	horrible service and ethics !
__label__0	zero stars just the middle finger .
__label__0	after _num_ minutes , the call was dropped .
__label__0	why would n't she tell me that from the beginning ?
__label__0	wrong !
__label__0	i have never felt so damn uncomfortable in my life !
__label__0	not joking _num_ freakin minutes i was in there and i was gone .
__label__0	horrible !
__label__0	Very negative
__label__0	if i could give negative rating omg i would .
__label__0	it was totally bland and was overwhelmed with ricotta cheese .
__label__0	the wings were just gross .
__label__0	they were a soggy , greasy , tasteless mess .
__label__0	the wings sucked .
__label__0	i spent _num_ bucks there .
__label__0	this place is horrible !
__label__0	food is n't good .
__label__0	service is n't good .
__label__0	edit : hi rick , i appreciate your desire for a resolution .
__label__0	under it 's current management it 's a complete ripoff .
__label__0	not impressed .
__label__0	assuming that they had it on file , i didnt even ask .
__label__0	failure one was not checking the address or even bothering to take one .
__label__0	the food has never been much more than convenient .
__label__0	do n't give them your business .
__label__0	i could not believe it .
__label__0	it literally ruined my night .
__label__0	so disappointed !
__label__0	tonight was terrible !
__label__0	the owner wo n't return calls and the staff wo n't help .
__label__0	worst delivery ever .
__label__0	order _num_ simple things was told 30-45 min which is find .
__label__0	the lady that answered was extremely rude and did n't care one dam bit .
__label__0	really over an hour behind and nothing .
__label__0	got off the phone another _num_ min later the driver got to our house .
__label__0	i , along with a couple of friends visited this place last friday night .
__label__0	anyway , the service lacked in every way .
__label__0	pizza was disgusting .
__label__0	rude management , tasteless food , overpriced .
__label__0	do n't waste your time or money here .
__label__0	yuck , yuck yuck .
__label__0	i 've been wanting chicken fingers all day .
__label__0	i also asked for hot sauce , guess what i got instead ?
__label__0	like wtf am i going to do with cherry sauce ?
__label__0	i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
__label__0	$ _num_ wasted on this place .
__label__0	the coupon says it 's only good tonight at the game .
__label__0	stand in line and get to the front but no pizza .
__label__0	manager says she needs it for inventory .
__label__0	long time streets customer who is now done with them for a long time .
__label__0	my pizza was cold .
__label__0	over cooked and disgusting .
__label__0	get a life , worse pizza in town !
__label__0	food was disgusting , raw chicken , cold and soggy .
__label__0	we literally could n't eat our dinner .
__label__0	no wonder the food was so bad .
__label__0	looked at the bottom of container barely any sauce .
__label__0	so sad .
__label__0	this is the worst excuse for italian food ever .
__label__0	honestly , i would only leave zero stars if i could .
__label__0	i just had a horrible experience with this location .
__label__0	then an hour goes by no food .
__label__0	another _num_ minutes goes by .
__label__0	no apologies , nothing .
__label__0	and food is cold , soggy , not edible by any means .
__label__0	this was a waste of time .
__label__0	worst food and customer service ever .
__label__0	big mistake .
__label__0	i guess that is not the case .
__label__0	now , the one advantage i thought was present , is not .
__label__0	i took my _num_ yr old dog into her first teeth cleaning last week .
__label__0	my poor pup , with no teeth at only _num_ yrs old .
__label__0	i hate them for not giving me the option by calling me first .
__label__0	this is a corporate vet and everything bad that corporate vets do .
__label__0	i do n't know how else to put it .
__label__0	so of course i am going to use the vet visit .
__label__0	it is all about up sale and scare tactics at this vet .
__label__0	which i expected , i have been to corporate vets before .
__label__0	i should not have gone .
__label__0	one of the worst animal hospitals i have ever been too !
__label__0	if we had waited any longer , they all would have been dead !
__label__0	bye bye forever mean people !
__label__0	horrible customer service .
__label__0	a month later , i still had not received my dryer back .
__label__0	fed up i called the district manager .
__label__0	i told him that is not my issue .
__label__0	i pay my bill monthly on time .
__label__0	after all , i am the customer .
__label__0	this store sucks .
__label__0	i would n't recommend it to anyone .
__label__0	after they hook you , they do n't care .
__label__0	from outside this place looks sketchy at best .
__label__0	the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
__label__0	we decided on may _num_ , _num_ .
__label__0	what a shame of a business you are running linda .
__label__0	i will be contacting groupon to get a refund .
__label__0	i wo n't come back .
__label__0	this on the other hand was a disaster from the beginning .
__label__0	i 'm not even kidding , it was falling off .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	do n't buy the groupon .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	_num_ .
__label__0	make sure you have time to burn , my mani/pedi took over two hours !
__label__0	i called the salon before purchasing the groupon to check their availability .
__label__0	the customer service that i experienced here was on par with any other salon .
__label__0	however , this is a school .
__label__0	as such , the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable .
__label__0	it is simply awful .
__label__0	i was very disappointed with my manicure .
__label__0	my pedicure , however , turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin .
__label__0	i would not recommend this salon , nor will i be returning .
__label__0	when entering , i was willing to give the techs a chance .
__label__0	usually , i could use my groupon right away but whatever '' .
__label__0	i washed my hands _num_ times that night .
__label__0	this is easily the worst motel _num_ i have ever stayed in .
__label__0	i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
__label__0	it 's not good here .
__label__0	not so good .
__label__0	the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
__label__0	i kept telling her no but she continued to insist she must come in .
__label__0	of course , i called management and they said they would security immediately .
__label__0	no child or baby here .
__label__0	it was weird .
__label__0	but no one told me !
__label__0	the front desk never called to check if the situation had been resolved .
__label__0	do n't stay here .
__label__0	it 's just too weird .
__label__0	i really do n't know if it was water .
__label__0	the water was barely flowing .
__label__0	this was beyond unacceptable !
__label__0	worst motel ever !
__label__0	lots of shady people out and about .
__label__0	cops always seem to be here .
__label__0	not a family friendly place at all .
__label__0	no bed bugs in my room though !
__label__0	but i do n't feel my vehicle is safe outside .
__label__0	the carpet had at least _num_ stains .
__label__0	drug deals out in the parking lot .
__label__0	the maids left the trash in the hallways all night .
__label__0	trash every where .
__label__0	my boyfriend and i recently drove cross country .
__label__0	we picked _num_ cities to stop in while driving .
__label__0	this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
__label__0	the area seemed very sketchy .
__label__0	i am glad we only stayed one night here .
__label__0	if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will not be staying here .
__label__0	this hotel sucks .
__label__0	if i could give it a _num_ i would .
__label__0	thank god we left at _num_ _num_ the next morning .
__label__0	bathroom looks like it had never been cleaned , ever .
__label__0	outside smells _num_ times better than my room did .
__label__0	maintenance replaced the phone .
__label__0	the next morning , we found that the water temperature would n't stay steady .
__label__0	could n't get out of the there fast enough .
__label__0	this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and felt very unsafe .
__label__0	i reserved a room with _num_ double beds no smoking .
__label__0	the front door was broken off of the cabinet that held the fridge .
__label__0	that was the only good thing about this place .
__label__0	call the front desk and request one , this is approx .
__label__0	7:30 am , i am told i will have to wait till _num_ am .
__label__0	i would rather be dirty than stay one more min in this place .
__label__0	the worst place i ever stayed .
__label__0	second night the room was not cleaned and no towels .
__label__0	just uncomfortable .
__label__0	my pillow case had a burned hole in it .
__label__0	the non-smoking room reeked , but that was n't even the start .
__label__0	the sheets , comforter , and towels were stained .
__label__0	ridiculous .
__label__0	i 've stayed at other super _num_ before and it was n't like this .
__label__0	by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
__label__0	it 's ghetto and the service is incredibly horrible .
__label__0	i 'm never going there again .
__label__0	i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get frustrated .
__label__0	half the lights do n't work .
__label__0	floor and ceiling look like they have been rode hard and hung up wet .
__label__0	online pick up you better be ready for long delays .
__label__0	no wonder they are closing down everywhere .
__label__0	waited _num_ minutes at the service desk .
__label__0	there were no check-out lanes open .
__label__0	never was waited on while the service desk person took customers out of order .
__label__0	i may shop there again - not ( unless pig 's fly ) .
__label__0	yo yelp people - why is n't there a zero star rating ?
__label__0	this place is terrible !
__label__0	_num_ hours later it was ready .
__label__0	nobody called me .
__label__0	how absurd !
__label__0	got a groupon deal that said i would get a synthetic blend oil change .
__label__0	manager said i could pay more to get a synthetic o change .
__label__0	made an appointment to get my oil changed at 8am on june 2nd .
__label__0	i asked them how long it would take ryan told me _num_ mins .
__label__0	what i was not fine with .
__label__0	nor will anyone else i know .
__label__0	_num_ and a half hours for a quoted _num_ min oil change .
__label__0	it would have been fine or i would have went else where .
__label__0	very rude , will not come back .
__label__0	but nothing show stopping .
__label__0	i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
__label__0	never again will i go back to this restaurant .
