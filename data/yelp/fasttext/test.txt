__label__0	ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .
__label__0	there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
__label__0	so basically tasted watered down .
__label__0	she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
__label__0	i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .
__label__0	just left and took it off the bill .
__label__0	it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
__label__0	definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
__label__0	new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .
__label__0	but it probably sucks too !
__label__0	we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .
__label__0	the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .
__label__0	there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
__label__0	said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
__label__0	the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
__label__0	there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
__label__0	the wine was very average and the food was even less .
__label__0	staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .
__label__0	the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .
__label__0	blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
__label__0	my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .
__label__0	she said `` yes , sorry . ''
__label__0	the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .
__label__0	there was only meat and bread .
__label__0	when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door .
__label__0	she was not happy being there .
__label__0	moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless .
__label__0	the associates program is no longer an option .
__label__0	the decor was seriously lacking .
__label__0	anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
__label__0	the sales people here are terrible .
__label__0	salsa is not hot or good .
__label__0	so i asked for the card to be refunded .
__label__0	i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .
__label__0	i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .
__label__0	all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .
__label__0	the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found .
__label__0	they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .
__label__0	we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .
__label__0	always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !
__label__0	they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
__label__0	i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .
__label__0	my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .
__label__0	when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .
__label__0	you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
__label__0	i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .
__label__0	i was very sick the night after .
__label__0	i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again .
__label__0	i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !
__label__0	had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .
__label__0	the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .
__label__0	this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
__label__0	then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .
__label__0	do not go to this practice they are horrible !
__label__0	i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
__label__0	the only saving grace was the black beans .
__label__0	lost a long time customer !
__label__0	other than that , food here is pretty gross .
__label__0	i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
__label__0	so far i 'm not really impressed .
__label__0	my groupon is only for the two windows .
__label__0	safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy .
__label__0	the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
__label__0	we will not be using this location again .
__label__0	this is a horrible venue .
__label__0	you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .
__label__0	do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
__label__0	but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
__label__0	owner : a very rude man .
__label__0	this place is a terrible place to live !
__label__0	stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
__label__0	my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
__label__0	it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .
__label__0	what about the time i wasted ?
__label__0	there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !
__label__0	the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
__label__0	executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .
__label__0	this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
__label__0	not even real brown sauce .
__label__0	i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play .
__label__0	but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
__label__0	his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .
__label__0	i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
__label__0	the salads are ok , nothing special .
__label__0	overall it was a miserable evening .
__label__0	the woman did n't even apologize .
__label__0	i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .
__label__0	zero complaints with his work .
__label__0	the garlic bread was bland and cold .
__label__0	the espresso was way too hot .
__label__0	i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
__label__0	they wo n't tell you though .
__label__0	i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
__label__0	gammage itself however is not so amazing .
__label__0	needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
__label__0	i wo n't be ordering again .
__label__0	let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .
__label__0	she did not apologize or anything .
__label__0	prices are just plain retail .
__label__0	but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .
__label__0	it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
__label__0	who knows , it might have been .
__label__0	the beer sauce is lackluster at best .
__label__0	the building itself looks abandoned .
__label__0	we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
__label__0	i 've never had a worse experience than this !
__label__0	no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .
__label__0	if i could give zero stars i def would .
__label__0	only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .
__label__0	no call , no nothing .
__label__0	i wish i could give less than one star .
__label__0	the wonton was seriously lacking filling .
__label__0	if i could give less stars , i would .
__label__0	she could not and would not explain herself .
__label__0	think twice -- this place is a dump .
__label__0	i 'm not one of the corn people .
__label__0	it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
__label__0	even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down .
__label__0	as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years .
__label__0	i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color .
__label__0	so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition .
__label__0	at this location the service was terrible .
__label__0	so who do i call to get my money back .
__label__0	overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .
__label__0	i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .
__label__0	service was a little slow to begin with .
__label__0	only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .
__label__0	the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .
__label__0	i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
__label__0	just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled .
__label__0	i expected so much better from this ny staple .
__label__0	i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .
__label__0	the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart .
__label__0	they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
__label__0	the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .
__label__0	i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .
__label__0	i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer .
__label__0	and the cleaning is way over priced .
__label__0	they make a bad name for used car dealers .
__label__0	when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
__label__0	just a frozen patty cooked like a home one .
__label__0	so sad but i am not going back any more .
__label__0	this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .
__label__0	the new management team is horrible !
__label__0	just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
__label__0	they also have lost sight of what good deli food is .
__label__0	the evening started out slow .
__label__0	i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool .
__label__0	the queen bed was horrible !
__label__0	meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .
__label__0	oh , i should not have asked .
__label__0	my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats .
__label__0	this place is just ok .
__label__0	i have to say i was truly disappointed .
__label__0	this is the reason i will never go back .
__label__0	furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .
__label__0	when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
__label__0	the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
__label__0	nope , way way worse .
__label__0	there are no smiles and no customer service .
__label__0	when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her .
__label__0	the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .
__label__0	if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck .
__label__0	plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer .
__label__0	overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .
__label__0	it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?
__label__0	the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .
__label__0	food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
__label__0	was n't busy , no biggie .
__label__0	the bathroom area is nothing special .
__label__0	this room that he found also reeked of smoke !
__label__0	also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards .
__label__0	so i brought my business elsewhere .
__label__0	exhibit c : no more student services peeps .
__label__0	so disappointing from an old favorite .
__label__0	it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
__label__0	tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .
__label__0	the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
__label__0	i will never visit the salon again .
__label__0	they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
__label__0	i would n't go back there again .
__label__0	this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .
__label__0	the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .
__label__0	as for the food , never had it .
__label__0	however , the tech said nothing to me about this .
__label__0	i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .
__label__0	my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .
__label__0	i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .
__label__0	it does not take that long to cook sliders !
__label__0	the sandwich was not that great .
__label__0	the man did not stop her .
__label__0	um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .
__label__0	tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
__label__0	it is also quite expensive for my taste .
__label__0	food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .
__label__0	lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh .
__label__0	it shows that this restaurant has no class .
__label__0	one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .
__label__0	we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .
__label__0	my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .
__label__0	when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
__label__0	we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .
__label__0	even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .
__label__0	wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .
__label__0	as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .
__label__0	the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
__label__0	but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
__label__0	just terrible is all i can say .
__label__0	did they not have a fountain machine on site ?
__label__0	his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .
__label__0	stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .
__label__0	we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .
__label__0	i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .
__label__0	always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
__label__0	however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .
__label__0	so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .
__label__0	overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
__label__0	one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .
__label__0	there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
__label__0	is zero stars an option ?
__label__0	in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
__label__0	but let this story begin at noon today .
__label__0	seriously though , i have never shopped here .
__label__0	it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
__label__0	but their inventory was questionable !
__label__0	chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .
__label__0	so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .
__label__0	were we irritating her or something ?
__label__0	this place has pissed me off for the last time .
__label__0	do not sign a lease with these people .
__label__0	do n't waste the trip .
__label__0	had to returned one entree because too cold .
__label__0	the restroom was a mess .
__label__0	i mean that 's been my experience !
__label__0	the beef taco was good but nothing special .
__label__0	either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .
__label__0	i went to sit down and wait for my order .
__label__0	its also not a very clean park .
__label__0	i tried to call repeatedly with no response .
__label__0	they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed .
__label__0	it looks old and outdated .
__label__0	he did not return my call either .
__label__0	if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .
__label__0	i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .
__label__0	the food here is bland and boring and bad .
__label__0	this one is not on the ball .
__label__0	for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !
__label__0	the tow package is not an issue either .
__label__0	very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .
__label__0	i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .
__label__0	i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
__label__0	you can not pay me to ever shop here !
__label__0	french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold .
__label__0	now the food : not horrible , but below average .
__label__0	this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
__label__0	no stars is what in want to give .
__label__0	when it came we should have sent it back .
__label__0	the equipment is so old and looks dirty .
__label__0	i 'm not willing to take the chance .
__label__0	this place smelt like old urine for some reason .
__label__0	bottom line they over promise and under deliver .
__label__0	i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
__label__0	nothing that special about this place .
__label__0	razz 's failed on every occasion .
__label__0	management no longer cares about the golf experience .
__label__0	20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool .
__label__0	the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .
__label__0	found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .
__label__0	not sure and i do n't care !
__label__0	two hours of my life i can never get back .
__label__0	dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .
__label__0	very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .
__label__0	service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits .
__label__0	second time , not so good .
__label__0	the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .
__label__0	he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
__label__0	what the hell are you doing ?
__label__0	the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
__label__0	i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
__label__0	the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
__label__0	finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .
__label__0	i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good .
__label__0	liar , liar , pants on fire .
__label__0	parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess .
__label__0	i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .
__label__0	not so great food and service .
__label__0	this is an old worn out hotel .
__label__0	the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
__label__0	the mechanics are very amateur as usual .
__label__0	this place is beyond a shit hole .
__label__0	this place is a shit hole with shit service .
__label__0	however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
__label__0	went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect .
__label__0	service was just as disappointing .
__label__0	i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
__label__0	the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
__label__0	management does not seem to care .
__label__0	i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back .
__label__0	it is not really brown rice .
__label__0	did n't even get a response .
__label__0	needless to say , i contacted the store manager directly after leaving .
__label__0	my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .
__label__0	i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .
__label__0	had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient .
__label__0	she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .
__label__0	i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care .
__label__0	i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are .
__label__0	it did n't get finished .
__label__0	we will not be coming back .
__label__0	he could n't actually read her pressure , though .
__label__0	absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
__label__0	ate kicked ass , marquee , not so much .
__label__0	even the water tasted horrible .
__label__0	and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
__label__0	sounds good does n't it ?
__label__0	but it was disgusting and hot in there .
__label__0	yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
__label__0	it was over fried and very hard .
__label__0	i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .
__label__0	the overall prices are not competitive with frys .
__label__0	too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .
__label__0	we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .
__label__0	and management does n't do anything about it .
__label__0	no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .
__label__0	what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
__label__0	i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !
__label__0	these days the quality is pretty lousy .
__label__0	this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .
__label__0	service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
__label__0	my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
__label__0	and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .
__label__0	maybe they were having a bad night ?
__label__0	this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !
__label__0	the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
__label__0	so , it went in the trash .
__label__0	it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed .
__label__0	so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .
__label__0	hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .
__label__0	the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .
__label__0	when it finally came out , it was bad .
__label__0	talk about false advertising so call before you go !
__label__0	the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
__label__0	crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .
__label__0	but the customer service ruins it all for me .
__label__0	i just walked out , called the manager to complain .
__label__0	i was very disappointed with this place .
__label__0	so you are n't my problem . ''
__label__0	unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts .
__label__0	geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .
__label__0	she does n't say anything and just walks away .
__label__0	the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry .
__label__0	the staff was nowhere to be found .
__label__0	it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .
__label__0	it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
__label__0	i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .
__label__0	save your money & your patience .
__label__0	what a waste of my time and theirs .
__label__0	one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .
__label__0	my fault for not looking more closely , i guess .
__label__0	the server was n't buying .
__label__0	worst customer service i have ever had .
__label__0	sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
__label__0	and for this reason , i wo n't return .
__label__0	this branch is getting worse and worse .
__label__0	they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .
__label__0	they can thank you for the low rating .
__label__0	i did n't even eat it .
__label__0	this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .
__label__0	there was no personality to our server .
__label__0	if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out .
__label__0	i did n't know ra was a chain .
__label__0	i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
__label__0	went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .
__label__0	this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .
__label__0	the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .
__label__0	i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .
__label__0	however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
__label__0	is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
__label__0	maria the manager is a horrible person .
__label__0	it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
__label__0	we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .
__label__0	first , the bartender was an a -- hole .
__label__0	absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
__label__0	i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
__label__0	oh well , who cares ... right ?
__label__0	we will spend our money elsewhere .
__label__0	i will never purchase another lv bag again .
__label__0	uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that .
__label__0	we did n't leave with anything that day .
__label__0	horrible , horrible , horrible service !
__label__0	now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
__label__0	this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .
__label__0	i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
__label__0	the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
__label__0	you can not judge people based on appearance .
__label__0	you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
__label__0	the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy .
__label__0	no courtesy and their food is pathetic .
__label__0	i would never reccomend anyone to live here .
__label__0	had to wait a month to get in .
__label__0	great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
__label__0	it was my last weekend visiting my folks .
__label__0	next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .
__label__0	do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .
__label__0	prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .
__label__0	tonight i lost all respect for this company .
__label__0	safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .
__label__0	i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .
__label__0	let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
__label__0	it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing .
__label__0	the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
__label__0	included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .
__label__0	the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
__label__0	other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
__label__0	the food is not that authentic .
__label__0	actually , just keep walking .
__label__0	unfortunately , it is the worst .
__label__0	the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
__label__0	not so much these days .
__label__0	did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
__label__0	this is the worst panda express location there is !
__label__0	the door would n't open at all .
__label__0	my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
__label__0	the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .
__label__0	we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
__label__0	i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .
__label__0	it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
__label__0	this is a terrible college .
__label__0	my jack and coke was seriously lacking .
__label__0	sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
__label__0	the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .
__label__0	i looked around and there were still customers .
__label__0	i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .
__label__0	we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .
__label__0	in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .
__label__0	avoid if at all possible .
__label__0	i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .
__label__0	we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .
__label__0	it 's just too expensive for what you get .
__label__0	also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?
__label__0	went into this location to drop it off .
__label__0	we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .
__label__0	if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .
__label__0	too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .
__label__0	the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .
__label__0	the beer was nice and cold !
__label__0	the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
__label__0	will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !
__label__0	there are much better places for breakfast .
__label__0	the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .
__label__0	it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .
__label__0	um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .
__label__0	pathetic place , worst food .
__label__0	needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
__label__0	firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
__label__0	anything they say , ask in writing .
__label__0	this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
__label__0	but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
__label__0	built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .
__label__0	bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .
__label__0	if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !
__label__0	she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .
__label__0	incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .

__label__0	sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !
__label__0	that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
__label__0	the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .
__label__0	they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
__label__0	desert followed but nothing special .
__label__0	no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
__label__0	i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .
__label__0	however , this experience went pretty smooth .
__label__0	they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .
__label__0	since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !
__label__0	she was getting pissed , and so were we .
__label__0	did n't seem to care about their job .
__label__0	would have rated lower if i could .
__label__0	not personalized or warm at all .
__label__0	so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .
__label__0	i do not like the size of the dance floor .
__label__0	this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .
__label__0	i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .

__label__0	an old dude did my pedicure .
__label__0	like it 's been in a fridge for a week .
